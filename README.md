# Frontend for Gunbound Thor's Hammer ðŸš€

### **1. Project Overview**
This project is a modernized **frontend for Gunbound Thorâ€™s Hammer**, a beloved game that has been revived using a custom game server. The frontend handles user registration, player rankings, and general game information, providing a clean and responsive interface for players to interact with the game. The backend server is built using **Node.js and Express** and relies on **MySQL 5.1.36** for data persistence.

### **2. Tech Stack**
- **Frontend Framework:** React (using Vite for fast builds)
- **Routing:** React Router v7
- **State Management:** Context API (for authentication)
- **Styling:** SASS
- **HTTP Client:** Axios
- **Date/Time Formatting:** date-fns

---

### **3. Key Features**
- **Home Page:** Overview of the game and navigation links.
- **Registration Page:**
  - Users can register by filling out details like username, email, password, gender, and country.
  - Admin token support for privileged registrations.
  - Error handling for server-side validation errors.
- **Player Rankings:**
  - Displays a ranked list of players sorted by Game Points (GP).
  - Ranks include labels (e.g., "Admin", "Wood Hammer") with icons.
  - Links to detailed player profiles.
- **Last Seen Users:**
  - Shows a list of users who were last online, with filters for last day, last 3 days, and last week.

### **4. Installation & Setup**

#### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed
- Backend server running (API endpoints must be available)

#### **Steps:**
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd gunbound-frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:
   ```env
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api  # Replace with your backend API URL
   ```
   Replace `localhost:5000` with the appropriate backend server URL if it's different.

4. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app should now be accessible at `http://localhost:5173/` (or the port assigned by Vite).

5. **Build for Production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. **Preview the Production Build:**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

### **7. Development Notes**

- **API Endpoints:**  
  The app communicates with the backend through endpoints like:
  - `POST /users/register`: Handles user registration.
  - `GET /users`: Retrieves player ranking data.
  - `GET /users/last-seen?days=X`: Retrieves last seen users within the specified timeframe.

- **SASS Styling:**  
  SASS is used for styling, and global classes are applied to the `<body>` using custom hooks like `usePageBodyClass()` to style different pages uniquely.

---

### **8. Potential Security Enhancements**
- **Input Validation:** Ensure that backend input validation matches the fields used in the registration form.
- **Environment Variables:** Avoid committing `.env` files to public repositories to keep API keys secure.
